Within the past year, I have discovered different ways to solve the same problem â€” managing the increasingly complex data requirements of React Native apps. In this talk, I go through how to manage remote data-flow in a React Native application, using 5 of different techniques including starting with Promises and eventually getting to how I now got to GraphQL.

This is modified talk I have done [previously on React](/posts/2017/01/31/managing-remote-data-flow-in-react). I took the same approach but made this React Native specific.
