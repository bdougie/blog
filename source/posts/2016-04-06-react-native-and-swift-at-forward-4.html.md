After 36 weeks of [learning iOS](https://www.bloc.io/ios-bootcamp) and [React Native]
(https://egghead.io/series/react-native-fundamentals), I was able
experience making apps in Objective-C, Swift, and React Native. 

The result of that became this Conference talk at Forward 4 in
February. 

*Note [towards the end](https://youtu.be/2d0z_L4oXt8?list=PLndbWGuLoHebKI8krCzJU88Rf3TwhNZvH&t=2252) of the talk I answered a question by eluding to a [React Native Radio](https://devchat.tv/react-native-radio/22-react-native-should-I-even-bother-learning-swift) podcast episode.

I was actually ask to be on that same podcast shortly after saying this and that episode is available to listen to [now]((https://devchat.tv/react-native-radio/22-react-native-should-I-even-bother-learning-swift) as well.
