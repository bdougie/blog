summary: Customize your bash with emojis
---

For awhile now I have wanted to customize my command prompt in my terminal, but I thought I was limited because I did not use the fancy [iterm](https://www.iterm2.com/) or [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

Customizing your command prompt in bash is pretty straight, forward. It only requires a little bit of reading and a lot of copy and pasting.

Recently during a discovery and research session on a flight across the country to Florida, I dig some easy Google searching and found my solution on the [Apple Stack Exchange](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125637/iterm-colors-for-prompt-command-and-output).
