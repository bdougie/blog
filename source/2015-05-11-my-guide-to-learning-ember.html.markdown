# My Guide to Learning Ember

Less than a year ago I took on the challenge of learning to develop with the ember(front-end javacript framework). I gave up rather quickly and did not revisit the challenge until I found a pretty indepth [tutorial](http://ember.vicramon.com/), which is now outdated. Shortly after the completion of this app I learned of [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) which has significantly decreased the size of my ember learning curve.

The following will be my recommendations to learning ember with the most
up to date tutorials and material. The majority of the ember blog post
and tutorials live on the web seem to out of date and my hope is to clearly lay out a path for
someone new to ember to begin learning.

**There are many tools to use in learning ember, but below are the recommendation I have personally used and completed.*

##[ember-cli-101](https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101)
Regardless of which path you take to learning ember, this book is must
purchase. Not only are you guranteed to have an up to date guide in
learning ember, the author has promised(and delivered) updates to the
book just as frequent as ember's new 6 week release cycle. 

At the end of the book you will have a good understanding in building a
vanilla ember application as wells as working with a few ember addons. 

##[Tilde Training](http://www.tilde.io/events/introduction-to-ember-online/)
This training comes with a cost but if you are like myself and
determined to get a grasp on understanding ember and its conventions, I do
recommend this. The video series is taught by the founding core team
members, [Tom Dale](https://twitter.com/tomdale) and [Yehuda Katz](https://twitter.com/wycats) and very insightful. 

You will walk away with a pretty nice music player app and get a better
understanding to how each component in ember works and a reason on why it's included in the framework straight from the horses mouth.

##[Ember Screencasts](http://www.emberscreencasts.com/)
Similar to the Railscast, [Jeffrey Biles](https://twitter.com/JeffreyBiles) has created [emberscreencast](http://www.emberscreencasts.com/) weekly snippets of pro and free videos going in depth on different tools and ways to implement features with ember. 

This [screencast](http://www.emberscreencasts.com/posts/26-client-side-pagination-part-1-basics) personaly helped me through some learning hurdles in
implementing pagination in my current ember application. 

##[Connecting to Rails-API to Ember](http://ryanlabouve.com/ember-problems-connecting-rails-api/?utm_source=Ember+Weekly&utm_campaign=cbb7e66bbf-Ember_Weekly_Issue_94&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e96229d21d-cbb7e66bbf-106354357)
This gem of a blog post and accompanied [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4H9rnhUyv4) helped me in understanding how to not only connect a rails api to my ember application, but also as a bonus exposed me to the [rails-api gem](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api). 

Ember prides itself on seprating the concerns of the api and the
client-side application and this blog post shows that very well. 


##[Ember Observer](http://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-cli-pagination)
Ember has a thriving community and the addons speak for that. The Ember
Observer is not only a great search tool for addons that work well with the
ember-cli, but it also provides useful addons ratings based on
the contributions and lastest updates.

##Honorable Mentions
Although these are not tutorials or learning materials, I recommend
subscribing to both of these podcast on ember, they will give you a
better insight on new material for learning ember.
